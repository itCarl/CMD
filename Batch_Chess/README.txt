Thank you for playing Batch Chess! I've put a lot of effort into it, so I hope you enjoy it.
While Batch Chess is packed with features, it does not have a checkmate/stalemate checking
system. IT CAN, however, check to see if either king is in check.
Feel free to email me [below] if you have coding ideas.

If you do not know how to play, then visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess

 -=Updates=-

 None yet; first release


 -=OS Requirements=-

Tested and works on:

•Windows XP (Will most likely require a choice command download. Read below.)
•Windows Vista
•Windows 7

Windows Command Prompt is required to play.
The choice command is also required. If you recieve an error regarding the choice command, or the input box
closes when you try to play, you can download the choice command via koltkoding.tk. 

There are 2 versions:
choice.com - 16 bit - http://www.mediafire.com/?4jwxa6hwvize6c4
choice.exe - 32 bit - http://www.mediafire.com/?867kqk4zax70net

If you do not know which one to download, try both versions.
